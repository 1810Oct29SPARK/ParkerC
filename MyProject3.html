        <h2>Bengal Facts</h2>
        <ol>
                <li>Originally from the US, this large breed is the result of a cross between a wild Asian cat and a domestic cat.</li>
                <li>The Bengal cat is considered domesticated from the 4th generation.</li>
                <li>The Snow Bengal is the result of a cross between an Asian leopard and a Siamese cat.</li>
                <li>The Bengal has an excellent memory. If they get stuck in a room all day, they will avoid that same place for several weeks.</li>
                <li>Don’t be surprised to see them bring you small 'presents' from the house or garden.</li>
                <li>Bengals can learn to open doors and lift up bin lids. It's better not to leave things lying around!</li>
                <li>Bengals like water! Don’t be surprised to find them in the bath or loitering near the sink when doing the dishes.</li>
                <li>A very intelligent breed, the Bengal cat is very sensitive to their owner's moods and will adapt their behaviour to it.</li>
                <li>This is a chatty breed! They will meow in a range of tones, from sharp to low, giving the impression of a wild animal.</li>
                <li>The coat is a Bengal's most notable characteristic. The base colour can be speckled or marbled.</li>
                <li>This breed is not one to doze on the couch all day long. They need to play and be stimulated a lot in order to expend their energy.</li>
                <li>Dog-like, Bengal's are easily trained and ca    n be taught tricks such as ‘sit', 'lie down', 'roll' and 'high five'.</li>
