                <P>This Cork pub is believed to be the oldest thatched pub in Ireland - and has been in the same family since way back in the 1600s. <br>
                     But it's not back in the dark ages and its pub grub and friendly atmosphere make this historical spot a must-visit.</P>

                    <p>You can hardly argue with the fact that this Mayo bar is owned by one of The Chieftains - and if he's not on tour, Matt will <br>
                        be there for the sessions. Have you left yet?</p>

                    <p>Confused by the hardware reference? Mary's is a cosy spot on Dublin's Wicklow Street - that just happens to be both a bar and <br> 
                        a fully functioning hardware shop which has got to be seen to be believed</p>

                    <p>Does exactly what it says on the tin - the thatched bar sits right on the Atlantic Ocean at the unspoiled Aughris Head and goes back <br>
                         a whopping 300 years.</p>

                <p>If you're heading to the Kingdom, this has got to be on your list. If you fancy a bed for the night, they even have their own self-catering apartments.</p>

                <p>In the same family for six generations, Downes still bottles its own whiskey, and even has a squash court on the premises. Definitely one for the list if you're in the sunny South East.</p>

                <p>This is a true gem nestled on Sullivan's Quay in Cork - and it's like a rural bar in the middle of the city. On the nights cards are being played, <br>
                    prepare to be told unceremoniously to move if you are sitting in a player's seat and there might even be a game of rings going. And it has got <br>
                    to be one of the last pubs in Ireland with the beer kegs still under the bar counter.</p>
